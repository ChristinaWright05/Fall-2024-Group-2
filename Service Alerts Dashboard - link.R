Link to Service Alerts Dashboard

It contains four charts displaying service alert totals for different categories.
Also explores the Other_causes category and identifies what subcategories fall under Other_causes.
The three remaining charts show what type of transports these alerts are for and the type of causes.
This could help us explore what type of alerts will show up in the future.
