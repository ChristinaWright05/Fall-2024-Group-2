Above I have pasted the link to my dashboard via Tableau Public.

These visualizations focus on the distribution of alerts by time of day, location, and primary causes. 
The bar chart highlights that alert frequency peaks during commuting hours, with the highest counts observed between 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM, suggesting a strong correlation with rush hour traffic.
The treemap identifies the most affected locations, with delays most frequently reported on the Newburyport/Rockport, Fitchburg, and Framingham/Worcester lines. 
Lastly, the table categorizes the major causes of alerts, showing that "Unknown Causes" and "Technical Problems" dominate delays, while "Construction" significantly impacts detours. 
This analysis helps to highlight the importance of addressing infrastructure and operational challenges to improve service reliability during peak hours and on critical transit lines.
