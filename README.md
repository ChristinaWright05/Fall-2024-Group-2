# Fall-2024-Group-2
Repository for Fall 2024 Software Tools for Data Analysis Group Project
Group Members: Angelo Nicolosi, Brian Sok, Ryan Kantor, & Christina Wright

## Progress on the eight major tasks
Task 1 has been completed. A GitHub repository has been created and we have established best practices for team collaboration. We have also made progress on tasks 2 through 5, as we have started to clean / process our data and have created multiple visualizations of our each of our datasets using R. We still need to do further analysis and determine our findings. The video presentation and markdown of our analytical story have also not been started yet, but we are keeping ideas in mind.

## Challenges and victories of collaborating
The challenges of collaborating have been a lack of knowledge of Git. Getting familiar with the commands has been a challenge. We also had issues with permissions but were quickly able to get that resolved. The victories have been easily tracking the work of the group. We have been able to see the work we have each done and what still needs to be accomplished. We are able to see each other's code, making sure everyone is aligned over text, and have also been meeting over zoom to discuss our updates.    

## Individual Contributions:
Angelo created a visual showing which types of alerts are most frequent. Brian created a visual showing the frequency of different severity types. Ryan created a visual showing the average severity code for each of the most frequent effect types. Christina merged the datasets and consolidated all of the work into one working document.
