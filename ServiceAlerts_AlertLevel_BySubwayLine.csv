No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there.
We recommend:
- Taking the Green Line C branch from Dean Road, about a 4-minute walk from Beaconsfield
- Accessing the Green Line D shuttle from Reservoir, about a 10-minute walk from Beaconsfield

This diversion is necessary for track and signal replacement and other infrastructure work. 

Express shuttle buses will run from Riverside to Copley during rush hour and Red Sox games.

No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there.
We recommend:
- Taking the Green Line C branch from Dean Road, about a 4-minute walk from Beaconsfield
- Accessing the Green Line D shuttle from Reservoir, about a 10-minute walk from Beaconsfield

Please allow extra travel time. All shuttle buses and stops are accessible.

No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there.
We recommend:
- Taking the Green Line C branch from Dean Road, about a 4-minute walk from Beaconsfield
- Accessing the Green Line D shuttle from Reservoir, about a 10-minute walk from Beaconsfield

Shuttle buses will operate in a one-way inbound loop through the downtown area. Shuttle buses will not stop at Bowdoin with Bowdoin riders instead asked to board and exit shuttles at Government Center Station. The shuttle bus stop at State station is drop-off only. Express bus shuttles will not stop at Maverick station.

All buses are accessible to customers with disabilities, see station personnel if you need assistance.

Ferry Service:
Alternate ferry services will also be available from Lewis Mall near Maverick station to Long Wharf. Riders should show their CharlieCard or CharlieTicket to boat crews for entry. Click on this link for the schedule. https://www.mbta.com/harbortunnel

About this work:
This acceleration of work replaces approximately one year of performing the work during nights and weekends. It also significantly reduces the costs associated with contractor crews mobilizing and demobilizing each night and each weekend, and costs for shuttle buses and transit operational support. The estimated savings for performing this accelerated work instead of during evening and weekend diversions over the course of one year is approximately $2-3 million.

Plan ahead to anticipate any unforeseen delays.","Free bus shuttles will replace Blue Line service between Airport and Bowdoin all day and every day between April 25 and May 17 to accommodate harbor tunnel repair work. Shuttle buses will operate in a one-way inbound loop through the downtown area. Shuttle buses will not stop at Bowdoin with Bowdoin riders instead asked to board and exit shuttles at Government Center Station. The shuttle bus stop at State station is drop-off only. Express bus shuttles will not stop at Maverick station.

All buses are accessible to customers with disabilities, see station personnel if you need assistance.

Ferry Service:
Alternate ferry services will also be available from Lewis Mall near Maverick station to Long Wharf. Riders should show their CharlieCard or CharlieTicket to boat crews for entry. Click on this link for the schedule. https://www.mbta.com/harbortunnel

About this work:
This acceleration of work replaces approximately one year of performing the work during nights and weekends. It also significantly reduces the costs associated with contractor crews mobilizing and demobilizing each night and each weekend, and costs for shuttle buses and transit operational support. The estimated savings for performing this accelerated work instead of during evening and weekend diversions over the course of one year is approximately $2-3 million.

All shuttle buses are accessible for persons with disabilities.

No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there.
We recommend:
- Taking the Green Line C branch from Dean Road, about a 4-minute walk from Beaconsfield
- Accessing the Green Line D shuttle from Reservoir, about a 10-minute walk from Beaconsfield

Additional work is scheduled for Oct 22 - 30.","All shuttle buses are accessible for persons with disabilities. Shuttle buses will stop at all D Branch stations, except for Beaconsfield. Below are some additional alternate travel options that D Branch riders may consider. 

Alternate Travel Options via Commuter Rail:
Riders who would typically board at Riverside and Woodland may consider the Auburndale and West Newton stops on the Framingham/Worcester Line for service to Lansdowne, Back Bay, and South Station. Lansdowne is about a 7 minute walk from Kenmore and about a 15 minute walk from the Longwood Medical Area. Bus routes 8, 19, 60, and 65 are available on Brookline Ave which is about a 1 minute walk from Lansdowne. These routes serve the Longwood Medical Area and Kenmore.

Alternate Travel Options via Green Line and Bus:
Reservoir - C Branch stop at Cleveland Circle, about a 5 minute walk
Beaconsfield - C Branch stop at Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk
Brookline Hills - Route 60 service, which is available at the intersection of Route 9 and Cypress St, about a 4 minute walk
Brookline Village - E Branch at Riverway, about a 7 minute walk. Additionally, bus routes 60, 65, and 66 are available at Washington St @ Walnut St, about a 5 minute walk. 
Longwood - C Branch stop Kent Street, about a 9 minute walk. 
Fenway - C Branch stop Saint Mary's Street, about a 5 minute walk

No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there. We recommend taking the Green Line C Branch from Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk.

Shuttle buses will stop at all D Branch stations, except for Beaconsfield. Below are some additional alternate travel options that D Branch riders may consider. 

Alternate Travel Options via Commuter Rail:
Riders who would typically board at Riverside and Woodland may consider the Auburndale and West Newton stops on the Framingham/Worcester Line for service to Lansdowne, Back Bay, and South Station. Lansdowne is about a 7 minute walk from Kenmore and about a 15 minute walk from the Longwood Medical Area. Bus routes 8, 19, 60, and 65 are available on Brookline Ave which is about a 1 minute walk from Lansdowne. These routes serve the Longwood Medical Area and Kenmore.

Alternate Travel Options via Green Line and Bus:
Reservoir - C Branch stop at Cleveland Circle, about a 5 minute walk
Beaconsfield - C Branch stop at Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk
Brookline Hills - Route 60 service, which is available at the intersection of Route 9 and Cypress St, about a 4 minute walk
Brookline Village - E Branch at Riverway, about a 7 minute walk. Additionally, bus routes 60, 65, and 66 are available at Washington St @ Walnut St, about a 5 minute walk. 
Longwood - C Branch stop Kent Street, about a 9 minute walk. 
Fenway - C Branch stop Saint Mary's Street, about a 5 minute walk

No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there. We recommend taking the Green Line C Branch from Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk.
